              single arbitrator to be appointed by the Arbitrators and Mediators
              Institute of New Zealand in accordance with the Arbitration Act
              1996. Unless agreed otherwise by Kai, all such mediation and

              discretion. All costs in relation to the staging of such
              proceedings (excluding for the avoidance of doubt any awards which
              may be made) shall be borne equally by the parties unless
              explicitly stipulated otherwise by the arbitrator or agreed
              otherwise by the parties.
